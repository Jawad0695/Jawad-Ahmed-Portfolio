## Hi, I'm Jawad Ahmed 👋

I am a graduate Mechanical Engineer with a strong interest in robotics, computer vision, and Visual SLAM. My work focuses on building end-to-end perception and navigation systems for mobile robots, with an emphasis on robustness, integration, and practical deployment.

I have hands-on experience implementing Visual SLAM pipelines using ORB-SLAM and RTAB-Map within ROS2 environments. My projects involve camera pose estimation, feature detection and matching, 3D mapping, and pose consistency, integrated with obstacle avoidance and path planning to evaluate SLAM performance in closed-loop navigation.

### Technical Skills
- **Visual SLAM:** ORB-SLAM, RTAB-Map, camera pose estimation, feature tracking, 3D mapping  
- **Robotics:** ROS2, mobile robot navigation, obstacle avoidance, path planning (A*)  
- **Perception:** Feature detection & matching, visual odometry, sensor integration  
- **Programming:** C++, Python  
- **Simulation & Tools:** Gazebo, RViz, Docker, Linux  
- **Research Interests:** Robust V-SLAM, pose-graph optimization, multi-robot localization, practical deployment of SLAM systems

I am interested in research- and development-oriented roles in Visual SLAM, robotic perception, and autonomous systems, and I enjoy translating research ideas into working robotic systems.
